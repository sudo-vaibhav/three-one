        <h2>📜 Preface</h2>
        <p>
          All the cloud providers conveniently try to tell you in their
          documentation and marketing material that self-hosting is a bad idea.
          Cloud is often expressed as the cheap and perfect solution to all
          hosting problems. But it's not.
        </p>

        <p>
          2021 was probably the worst year ever for cloud uptime SLAs and in
          most cases, you can buy a hardware equivalent of your cloud VM and
          host it yourself, and within a few months, you would have recovered
          your initial capital investment, when compared to the expensive cloud
          pricing.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I have said above is valid for most small businesses and folks
          who are just starting out. Your apps are not going to be flooded by
          millions of users anytime soon. And no matter how much you'd like to
          think so, your app doesn't require a 24x7 uptime.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I made this website and decided to self-host it from an old RPi I
          had lying around.

        <h2>🌦️ Cloudflare to the Rescue</h2>

        <p>
          Cloudflare Tunnels create an encrypted tunnel between your server and
          the Cloudflare network using the cloudflared daemon. Because of this,
          users won't directly connect to your server, instead they will connect
          via proxy through Cloudflare's network.
        </p>

        <h2>🏆 Benefits</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            There is no need to open any ports on your network. To the outside
            world and even your ISP, your server just looks like any other
            encrypted web traffic.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is no need to create, buy or mange TLS certificates as
            cloudflared handles all of this for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cloudflare utilizes smart routing to speed up traffic latency. They
            avoid congested network and high latency area which routing the
            traffic through their edge network.
          </li>

          <li>You get a WAF and DDOS protection built in.</li>
        </ul>
